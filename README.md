# MD-To-MTurk-Survey
Project to handle boilerplate code of MTurk survey given a template file

There are only a couple of types of questions that I'm interested in asking on MTurk.
This project tries to remove some of the HTML boilerplate so I can focus on the actual questions.

If I had to do this again, I think I would just use macros...
Or some nice `into`/`from` traits with Rust.
